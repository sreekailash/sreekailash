## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work as a decision scientst at Adobe during the day. When I am not working, I love to reearch on causal inference, build tools that make this field more accessible and above all, LEARN. 

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to contribute to any Open Source repository that furthers the field of causal inference (quasi-experimentation, causal ML, observational inference, etc. - you name it!).
